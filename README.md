This document provides a general description of the desired system. It is to be a 24/7 interactive knowledge station which students can access in order to teach others or learn from peers and/or instructors in the areas of Math, Computer Science, and the Sciences. The system is to facilitate mobile access allowing easy access via mobile devices such as smartphones and iPads.
With the use of this interactive system, students should be able to live help from another student and/or a faculty via:

 - A curated discussion forum
 
 - Peer-to-peer chat
 
 - Collaborative drawing board
 
In general then, users of the system should be able to post questions (text/graphics), and provide answers (via text, graphical illustrations, and voice) in a forum or one-on-one.
